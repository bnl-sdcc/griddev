This is an attempt to adapt the Event ATCT for the sake of producing announced events and facility-related happenings (downtime, maintenance, etc).  The product also includes the ability to 'announce' these event-ish objects via email to a pre-determined selection of email lists, which can be configured in the product schema and class definitions.  Other custom fields are also defined in the product schema and can be configured there as necessary.

Though this product is developed for a specific computing facility, and the field values are hard-coded as such, they are easily identifiable and can be changed for other facilities, organizations, or purposes.
