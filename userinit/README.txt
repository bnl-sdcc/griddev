UserInit
============

Simple system init script that allows user-based init scripts to be started/stopped
upon system startup and shutdown. 

Set homedir root and subdirectory to be checked in /etc/sysconfig/userinit.

Be careful--do not use this with large numbers of home directories, especially within NFS.
