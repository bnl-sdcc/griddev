BOXGRINDER FIXES

For our purposes, the current version of Boxgrinder has some bugs which need to be fixed before use. These have been supplied to the Boxgrinder developers, so in theory they should be fixed in the main distribution eventually. 

HOW TO APPLY PATCHES

This patch was generate against boxgrinder version boxgrinder-build-0.10.2-1 on FC16. It is good for boxgrinder 10.2 and 10.4. 

On Fedora:

cd /usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.X      (where X is the correct version)
patch -p8 < /path/to/boxgrinder/bg-patches/bgbuild-fix.patch

BUG DESCRIPTION

Bugs:

-- OS plugin handling of i386/x86-64 dependencies:

/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/os/rpm-based/rpm-dependency-validator.rb

By default, builds of 64-bit platforms do not include i386 in the package architecture requested during package installation. This means that there is no way to request the 64 bit and 32 bit versions of a package. My patch simply adds i386 to the valid list for 64-bit builds, allowing specification of i386 packages, e.g. lib-foo.i386.
    
     
    
-- EC2 rc local:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/src/rc_local

The rc local template in the EC2 platform plugin was using an old URL for UserData runtime contextualization. It was also using curl in an unprotected fashion, such that it would assume it got valid data whether any had been set or not. When VMs are run from non-Amazon toolsets, there may not be any keys or other userdata associated with an instance. My patch confirms that curl returned successfully, and that the answer is valid.

  
        
    
-- EC2 platform plugin kernel handling:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/ec2-plugin.rb

The EC2 platform plugin removes the standard kernel package and installs the required kernel-xen package. But when done in this order, other packages that depend on packagename ‘kernel’ get removed. But they don’t get re-installed during the xen-kernel install. Simply reversing the order fixes the problem, since the kernel>=X.Y.Z requirement remains satisfied throughout the sequence of operations.
    
    
 
-- EC2 platform distribution handling:
/usr/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/boxgrinder-build-0.10.2/lib/boxgrinder-build/plugins/platform/ec2/ec2-plugin.rb

The EC2 platform plugin forgot to properly handle SL similarly to RHEL and CentOS in  the need to explicitly install kernel-xen. A patch adds in that check so that SL is treated the same.
