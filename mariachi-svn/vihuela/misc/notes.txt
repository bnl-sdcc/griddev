Various development notes
======================================

Looked into just using the htcp utility from Gridsite, but it uses curl, which
will throw errors if it cannot verify the server-side cert. We'd love for it to
do it, but it seems to require its own CA file "bundle" (rather than just
looking in /etc/grid-security) and there was no clear docs to tell it where
to look. 

Probably better to use native python anyway.

Since the upload daemon needs to run non-interactively, whatever certificate is used
needs to not have a password applied to the private key. For testing, it may
be handy to convert a user cert with a passphrase to one without. 

Use:
openssl rsa -inform PEM -outform PEM -in userkey.pem -out userkeynopw.pem

DAQ box setup:
  install pyvault, fix alternatives links. System default remains 2.3 (SL4)

Form design for mod_gridsite directory. 

New directory form:
<form 
    method=post 
    action="/gridsite/gridsite-admin.cgi">
    <tr>
        <td colspan=8><hr width="75%"></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>New name:</td>
        <td colspan=3>
            <input type=text name=file size=25>
            <td colspan=2 align=center>
            	<input type=submit name=button value="New file">
            </td>
            <td colspan=2 align=center>
            	<input type=submit name=button value="New directory">
             </td>
             	<input type=hidden name=cmd value=edit>
             </td>
    </tr>
</form>

Existing file upload form:
<form 
       method=post 
       action="/gridsite/gridsite-admin.cgi" 
       enctype="multipart/form-data">
        <tr>
                <td colspan=8><hr width="75%"></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td rowspan=2>Upload file:</td>
                <td colspan=2>New name:</td>
                <td colspan=6>
                        <input  type=text name=file size=25> 
                        <input  type=submit value=Upload>
                </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
                <td colspan=2>Local name:</td>
                <td colspan=6>
                        <input type=file name=uploadfile size=25>
                </td>
        </tr>
</form>
