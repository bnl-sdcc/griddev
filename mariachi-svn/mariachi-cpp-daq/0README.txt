This is an example of what can be developed to c++ daq system.

An executable acquires an electronic box 10 times per minute 60 times
displaying with each new second how many words it read and a content
of the first input counter.

Basically it's a "copy" of the corresponding LabView code.

Next steps would be:
1) Break into few files:
   -FPGA stuff should be a separate file
   -separate .h file for the main program ?
2) Learn how to work with a serial port (GPS)
3) Stop a program on ^C
