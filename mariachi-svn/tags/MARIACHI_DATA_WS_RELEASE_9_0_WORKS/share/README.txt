How to run this:
----------------
1. Unpack everything to some directory (DIR from now on)
2. Start R. The following are commands in R:
3. >setwd("DIR") # sets the default directory to DIR. Windows users
                 # should use forward slashes "/" instead of usual back
                 # ones "\" in defining the DIR path OR they can do it
                 # through a menu ("Change Directory")
4. >source("manalysis.R") # Windows users can do that through the menu
5. >mexample()
6. Play with produced files. See what is inside manalysis.R
